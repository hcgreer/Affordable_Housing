# Affordable_Housing

Used data provided by the Nashville department of housing to analyze the effects of affordable housing on surrounding properties. This was done by taking a list of homes sold across Nashville and pairing them with the closest affordable housing. Once that was done then applying a linear model to see if there is a negative effect on the home price post affordable housing. 

#Conclusion 

My team found that there was actually a slight increase in price post affordable housing. That houses closer to the affordable housing were selling 2 to 7% higher than those further away. However, these are still just estimates and with a lot of variables being accounted for the model still needs some perfecting. Though for the simple model it is apparent that there is no negative effect from affordable housing like many think.
